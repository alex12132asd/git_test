1. cloned a copy of the repository onto my local machine
2. added a file, README.md onto my local machine
3. the next step is to add it from my working directory onto the staging area for commit
4. commit from the staging area and add a message indicating what CHANGES were made
// git add README.md
// git commit -m "added README.md"
// git push origin master (this will push it to the remote repository)
* makes edit to README.md* and types "git status" in terminal will give the following reuslts :
// Changes not staged for commit //modified : README.md = *an edit has been MODIFIED in the working directory, would you like to add it to the staging area?*
